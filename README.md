# Bitcoin Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices using historical data obtained from a dataset containing open, close, high, and low columns. Various technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastic Oscillator, Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and Average True Range (ATR) were calculated to analyze market trends and volatility. The data was cleaned by removing outliers identified through boxplots and heatmaps. Machine learning models, including Random Forest and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), were trained on the preprocessed data to predict Bitcoin prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical Bitcoin price data, including open, close, high, and low columns. Additional technical indicators were derived from these columns to enhance feature representation for modeling.

## Preprocessing
1. Calculated technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands, Moving Average, RSI, Stochastic Oscillator, VWAP, and ATR.
2. Cleaned the data by removing outliers identified through boxplots and heatmaps.

## Modeling
1. Trained various machine learning models, including Random Forest and MLP, on the preprocessed data.
2. Conducted feature importance analysis using Random Forest to identify and eliminate irrelevant features.
